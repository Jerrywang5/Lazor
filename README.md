DO YOU GET A PROBLEM SOLVING LAZOR GAME? HERE IS YOUR IDEAL CHEAT TOOL.

# Lazor Group Project 
Group Members: Zhenqin Wang, Han Zhang, Han Zong

This project focuses on finding solutions of a IOS and Android game App, Lazor. 
We used python as the programming language to crack the puzzle.
There are three different types of blocks:reflection, refraction and opauqe. 
--Reflection blocks reflect incoming laser beams; 
--Refraction blocks not only let the laser beam pass through but also reflect the laser beam at contact points; 
--Opaque absorb all incoming laser beams and can be treated as deadend for beam paths. 

How TO USE LAZOR_SOLVER:(basic user manual for this project)

--Simply call in the lazor puzzle board file format in the command line.
--It will automatically output the solved positions of blocks in the grid. 
--It is fairly intuitive.
